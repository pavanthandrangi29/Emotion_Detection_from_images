# Emotion Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Introduction
This project aims to detect human emotions from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It utilizes deep learning techniques to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger,disgust,cry etc., based on facial expressions captured in images and also tells the emotions from the webcam.
